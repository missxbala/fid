<p>Not is our food good, it's also good-looking! Our patrons often stop to admire our fare with a quick Instagram before digging in. We've collected a few of our favorite shots here.</p>

<h2>Our Baked Goods</h2>
<p><a href="bread.html"><img src="bread-200.jpg" alt="close-up of sliced rustic bread" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
  We start our day at the crack of dawn to bake our own muffins, bread, and dinner rolls. Loaves not used that day are donated to the local food shelter. </p>

<h2>Our Burgers</h2>
<p><a href="burgers.html"><img src="burgers-200.jpg" alt="close-up of burger" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
  People come from all over to enjoy our lovingly made burgers. We grind our own locally-sourced organic beef and turkey so you know it's fresh and free from fillers and other nonsense. Go for one of our creative topping combos or stick with the classics. </p>

<h2>Catch of the Day</h2>
<p><a href="fish.html"><img src="fish-200.jpg" alt="close-up of fish" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
  Our chef works with local fisherman to pick the freshest the sea has to offer for our daily seafood special. Our Roast Cod Caponata with Roasted Potatoes is an old favorite with our regulars.</p>

<h2>Our Chicken Tenders</h2>
<p><a href="chicken.html"><img src="chicken-200.jpg"alt=close-up of chicken"" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
  Who doesn't love chicken? Come and try out our made to order, mouth watering tenders. Our chefs only work with the finest quailtiy cuts of chicken to serve you the best chicken of your life.</p>

<h2>Our Fries</h2>
<p><a href="fries.html"><img src="fries-200.jpg" alt="close-up of fries" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
 Our most popular menu item is hands down our triple fried fries served with our house made ketch-up. Even though we go through hundreds of potatos daily, we always seem to runout after lunch time. So you better order fast, for they will not last.</p>
<h2>5 Star Tabouleh</h2>
<p><a href="tabouleh.html"><img src="tabouleh-200.jpg" alt="close-up of tabouleh" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
  Looking for a more refined dish? Well look no further, come and try our 5 star Tabouleh. But be warned, you can never just eat one.</p>
